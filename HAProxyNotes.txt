Hello,
I've included some diagram image to understand better what I am trying to achieve.

Client IP should send packets to VPS Proxy IP which should then be forwarded to the SERVER IP but include the client IP. 

I have to add that we're not using port 80 or http, we're using ports: (2106 and 7777)

So for both ports packets should be forwarded to Server IP with real client ip NOT VPS IP.
haproxy, tunnel... reverse proxy what ever you recommend
VPS = LINUX
SERVER = Windows Server
